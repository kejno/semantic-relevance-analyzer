### outputs/pr_review.json (multi-Test-Case PR — only one file has issues)
A Story's test-automation PR often bundles several Test Cases (one spec file
per ticket). Here `SCRUM-25.spec.ts` and `SCRUM-26.spec.ts` are clean;
`SCRUM-27.spec.ts` is missing an assertion. Only SCRUM-27 gets a BLOCK entry —
SCRUM-25 and SCRUM-26 must NOT be penalized for an issue confined to a
different file, even though the overall PR `recommendation` is BLOCK because
at least one Test Case blocks merge:
```json
{
  "recommendation": "BLOCK",
  "summary": "SCRUM-25 and SCRUM-26 are correct. SCRUM-27 is missing the required text-muted assertion after the dark-theme toggle.",
  "generalComment": "outputs/pr_review_general.md",
  "inlineComments": [
    {"path":"tests/e2e/SCRUM-27.spec.ts","line":14,"body":"🚨 BLOCKING: Only toBeVisible() is asserted after switching to dark theme. The expected result requires verifying the text-muted token is still applied, not just that the element isn't hidden.","severity":"BLOCKING"}
  ],
  "issueCounts": {"blocking":1,"important":0,"suggestions":0},
  "perTestCase": {"SCRUM-25": "APPROVE", "SCRUM-26": "APPROVE", "SCRUM-27": "BLOCK"}

## Automated Test PR Review — BLOCK

**Summary**: Test contains a brittle CSS selector and a fixed timeout instead of Playwright's built-in auto-waiting assertions.

**Next Steps**:
1. Replace the CSS selector with a role-based locator (getByRole/getByText), matching tests/e2e/resume.spec.ts
2. Replace waitForTimeout with an auto-retrying expect(...) assertion
```
